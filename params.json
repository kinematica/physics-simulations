Our goals are to find elegant ways to illustrate nonintuitive phenomena through interactive physics demonstrations, and to make it easier for other people to make beautiful physics demos of their own.\r\n\r\n### [Physics Simulations](physics-simulations)\r\nCheck out some of the physics demonstrations we've put together.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nStefan Countryman: @stefco\r\n\r\nLiutauras Rusaitis: @rusaitis","google":"UA-63606206-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
