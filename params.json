You'd naturally expect the wheel to just fall and dangle, but the *spinning* of the tire—its **angular momentum**—causes it to *precess* about the rope! Try playing with the mass of the weight and the speed of the tire, and see how it affects the speed of precession!\r\n\r\n### Special relativity\r\n[Light Particles on a Train:](sr) Let's say you flashed a light in the middle of a moving train for just a split second—long enough to release a single light particle, or **photon**. If you're sitting in the train, you'd see the photons hit the opposite walls of the train at the same time. Naturally, someone standing by the side of the tracks would likely agree with you. But, if the train was moving fast enough—close to the speed of light—then *the observer on the side of the road would see the backward-moving photon hit the back of the train first! See it from both perspectives in this demo, and notice how strong the effect is when the train's speed gets close to *c*, the speed of light.\r\n\r\n## About Us\r\n[Kinematica](../) is a couple of students in Columbia's Physics Department making fun physics demos and software tools for physics education. Our goals are to find elegant ways to illustrate nonintuitive phenomena through interactive physics demonstrations, and to make it easier for other people to make beautiful physics demos of their own.\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\nStefan Countryman: @stefco\r\n\r\nLiutauras Rusaitis: @rusaitis","google":"UA-63606206-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
