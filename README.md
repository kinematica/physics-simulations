# Physics Simulations

For now, just start by installing Konva. Navigate to whatever folder you cloned this into and type:

```
bower install konva
```

If you don't have Bower (a popular JavaScript package manager) installed yet, use NPM (Node Package Manager) to install it:

```
npm install -g bower
```

...where the `-g` option specifies that you'd like Bower to be 'globally' available. *If you don't have Node/npm installed*, [download it at nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org).

These are toy simulations meant as practice for public outreach. Hopefully this will be interesting/intuitive/instructional to someone.
